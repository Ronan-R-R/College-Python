Duck typing
    it is a programming concept used in dynamic programming languages, where the the of an object is determined
    not by its class or type, but its behavior.
    If an object has all the methods and attributes required to preform a certain operation, it's considered
    to be the correct type of that operation
    Duck typing allows flexible code since objects are not required to be of specific class or type to be used
    in a certain way.
