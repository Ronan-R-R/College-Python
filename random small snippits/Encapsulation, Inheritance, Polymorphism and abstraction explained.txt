Python is an object oriented programming
1. encapsulation:
    this involves bundling related data and methods into a sinple unit, such as a class and hiding the implemantation
    details from the user.
    The user can interact with the class through its public method, which privides a simplified interface.
     
2. inheritance:
    this allows you to create a new class that is modified version of ab existing classs, inheriting its properties
    and methods.  The new class(child class) can provide them with a simplified interface that abstracts away some
    of the complexity of the original class.

3. Polymorphism:
    it refers to the ability of object of different classes to be used interchangeably, this allows to create generic
    code that can work with object of different types, without having to know the specific details of each object

4. Abstraction:
    refers to the concept of hiding complex implentation details and provide simplified interface for the user to
    interact for the user to interact with. IT is a powerfull tool for creatingmodular, maintainable and resuable
    code in python
